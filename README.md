# Loan Eligibility Expert System (LEES)

This is a rule-based **Loan Eligibility Expert System (LEES)** built using the **Experta** library in Python. The system mimics the decision-making process of a human loan officer by evaluating loan applicants against a set of predefined rules.

## 🔍 Project Description

LEES is designed to assess personal loan applications using a knowledge-based approach. It uses a set of logical rules (e.g., income level, credit history, age, employment status) to determine whether an applicant is eligible for a loan, and it provides a reason for approval or rejection.

The system serves as an educational and practical example of how **Expert Systems** can be implemented using **Python and Experta**.

## ✅ Features

- 🧠 Rule-based logic using Experta
- 📊 Evaluates multiple loan eligibility criteria
- 📝 Provides clear explanations for approval or rejection
- 📂 Supports uploading applicant data via CSV
