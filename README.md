# Flask Full-Stack Web Application

This is a full-stack web application built with **Flask (Python)** as the backend framework. It demonstrates how to combine server-side logic with dynamic HTML templates and static frontend assets (CSS, JS). The application can serve as a foundation for building more complex systems such as dashboards, content management tools, or data-driven platforms.

## Features

- 🧠 Backend: Flask for routing, templating, and server logic
- 🎨 Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration via Flask templates
- 📦 Organized folder structure for templates, static files, and app logic
- 🔧 Easily deployable on platforms like Replit, Render, or Railway
- 📁 Configurable via `requirements.txt` and `config.py`
